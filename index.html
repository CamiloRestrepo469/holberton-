         <h1>The top prominent and popular types of music</h1>
           <h2>History</h2>
            <img class="izquierda" class="imagg"  class="mmg" id="imagg" src="https://newesc.com/wp-content/uploads/M%C3%BAsica-sin-Copyright-Gratis-585x400.jpg" alt="music" width="335px"  height="255px">
           <p class="paragraph">
           The origin of music is shrouded in mystery, although it is estimated that it began in the prehistory of humanity and is linked to mating rites and collective work.
           Dance and song seem to have been associated from the beginning with the way in which the human being understands the world.
           <strong>Music has been part of our lives almost since we were born, and for many it is considered the food of the soul.</strong>
           There are different types of music, and each person can vary in their tastes.
           Research results show that music is a powerful form of social expression that can reinforce stereotypes and favors the expression of one's own identity.
           But beyond musical tastes, it is clear that the feeling of listening to music that we like is unique and even indescribable.
           Music makes us feel incredible sensations and makes us feel different emotions: joy, ecstasy, happiness.

            <h3 class="h3">1. Classical music</h3>
            <img class="derecha" src="https://musicaporlaface.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/musica-clasica-libre-de-derechos-1.jpg" alt="clasica" width="335px"  height="255px" >
           <p class="paragraph">
           <strong>Classical music is a stream that begins around 1750 and ends around 1820, in Europe.</strong> Today this type of music is associated with serious people, as it is a
           cultured style,typical of a very formal, refined and elitist environment.
           When someone imagines this type of music, the image of large orchestras, with many instruments, directed by the figure of a director, quickly comes to mind.
           The dress is formal, with an image of respect and seriousness.<em> Classical music is expressed in concertos</em> (soloist accompanying the orchestra) and symphonies
           (a choir of voices and instruments).

          <p class="paragraph">
           In the 1960s,<strong> rock and roll was losing its best artists.</strong> Elvis Presley was in the army, Little Richard had left rock and roll, and Buddy Holly and Ritchie
           Valens had died in a plane crash. But many young people continued to listen to his records, and some began to explore the origins of the music.
           The young musicians also became interested in R&B, studying its harmony and characteristics, and soon learned to play it. Before long they were combining these older styles
           with rock and roll to create a new genre called "rock." If rock and roll was danceable, rock is no longer danceable, and focuses on transmitting pure energy and lack of control.
          Over time, the electric guitar is given more weight and other subgenres of rock emerge such as hard rock, psychedelic rock, punk rock or folk rock.

            <h5>
              <em> The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, David Bowie, Jim Morrison or AC/DC took rock to a higher level.</em>

          <h3>3.Metal</h3>
          <div>
            <img class="derecha" src="https://www.fiftysounds.com/images/gallery/thumbnails/meeting-point.jpg" alt="metal" width="335px"  height="255px" >
          <p class="paragraph">
           <strong> Metal starts from hard rock during the 70's and experiences an explosion of musical groups during the 80's throughout the Western countries.</strong> Its main
           characteristic is the importance given to the electric guitar and the drums, to generate forceful and energetic sounds.
           Although many people use "heavy metal" and "metal" interchangeably, others distinguish between metal as a broad category and heavy metal as the original trajectory of early
           bands, from which alternative subgenres have emerged in recent decades.
           On the other hand, the use of vowels is very varied, ranging from high pitches to the use of techniques to make the voice sound deeper and more beastly than normal. In the
           Scandinavian countries, especially, the popularity of metal subgenres known as black metal and death metal stands out, in which the lyrics are practically unrecognizable due to
           the use of the form of shouting that is used.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            </div>
          <em> Iron Maiden, Manowar, Opeth, Metallica, Pantera, Anthrax or System of a Down are well-known representatives of metal.</em>
          </p>

           <h3>4. Pop</h3>
           <img  class="izquierda" src="https://www.fiftysounds.com/images/gallery/thumbnails/neon-lights.jpg" alt="pop" width="335px"  height="255px" >
           <p class="paragraph">
           Pop music is not really a genre of music.<strong> "Pop music"</strong> means popular, and as the name suggests, it is music for the masses. Technically, outside of pop music
           we would find classical music and other similar art forms. However, the term "pop music" is often used to talk about the most popular types of music and close to social
           conventions about what is successful music and with the ability to be listened to by millions of people around the world. world in practically any situation: discos, shops,
           advertisements, etc.
           Thus, pop includes different types of musical genres and has more to do with the audience for which the songs are intended. For example, Michael Jackson, known as the King of
           Pop, composed and performed songs from different genres: soul, funk, disco, rock, R&B, etc. His is the best-selling album in history, called "Thriller."

                <p class="paragraph">
                <em> Michael Jackson, Madonna, Britney Spears, Mariah Carey, Shakira, Elton John, and Justin Timberlake are popular artists.</em>
                Here you can see one of Michael Jackson's great classics: Billie Jean.

           <h3>5. Salsa</h3>
             <div>
              <img class="derecha" src="https://cdn.aarp.net/content/dam/aarp/entertainment/art_music/2016/10/1140-10-salsa-classics-collage-esp.jpg" alt="salsa" width="335px"  height="255px" >
             </div>
          <p class="paragraph">
           Salsa is a musical style that is closely linked to the dance that receives the same name. The word salsa as such has its origin in the New York Bronx, although the
           influences are purely Latin, with Cuba possibly being the country with the most weight in its creation.
           Afro-Cuban rhythms such as mambo, guaracha, son, montuno, Afro-Cuban jazz, among others,<strong> spread throughout Latin America and also reached the United States</strong> ,
           where the Cuban population is notable. Salsa is one of the most popular musical styles among Hispanic cultures.
           </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
           <em> HÃ©ctor Lavoe, Tito Puente, Celia Cruz and Ray Barreto<strong> perfectly represent this type of music.</strong></em>
